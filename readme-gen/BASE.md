# Simple Editor

**Important goals**:

- Ease of configuring, building and use.
- Fast movement and editing.
- Small code base of up to 2000 lines.
- No dependencies.
- Extensibility.

**Examples of what may be in separate patches**:

- Automatic saving.
- Syntax highlighting.
- UTF-8 support.
- Key macros.
- Regular expressions.
- Configuring using `~/.config/se/se.conf` or something like that.

**Must be avoided**:

- Multiple windows support.
- File browser.
- Support for plugins written in another language.
- LSP.

# Usage

Open a file:

```
$ se <path>
```

Normal mode keys:

- `a` - start of row.
- `d` - end of row.
- `e` - go to begin of next token.
- `h` - go left.
- `i` - switch to insert mode.
- `j` - go down.
- `k` - go up.
- `l` - go right.
- `n` - create a row below the current row and move to it.
- `q` - go to begin of previous token.
- (X) `r` - redo last undo;
- `s` - go to end of file.
- (X) `u` - undo last change.
- `w` - go to begin of file.
- (X) `/` - start or end search.
- `CTRL+d` - delete current row.
- `CTRL+n` - create a row above the current row and move to it.
- `CTRL+s` - save.
- `CTRL+q` - quit. If you changed the file, you will need to either save it or press this key several times.
- `CTRL+x` - save to spare directory. Useful if no privilege to write to opened file.

You can also repeat a key by pressing `<number><key>`. For example, `5n` will create 5 rows below the cursor.

Insert mode keys:

- `ESC` - switch to normal mode.
- `Backspace` - erase character before cursor.
- `Enter` - break row.
- Otherwise the character is inserted.
